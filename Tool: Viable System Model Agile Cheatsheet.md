- **Internal remarks & todos:** 
    - {{[[TODO]]}}  Transducers are still missing, e.g.
        - Example: [[Glossary]] -> [[Sense Making]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}}  Algedonic System is missing too.
        - Pain/lust channel in the event of catas- or anastrophies. 
        - Recursion level(s)
- **Development background of the cheatsheet:** IT/Digital industry, therefore heavily influenced by the corresponding terminology
- # Purpose of the Cheatsheet
    - Make it as easy as possible to create a viable system (no matter which recursion level one is looking at).
- # Guiding Question
    - Does this cheatsheet has the [[Requisite Variety]] to create a viable system?
- # Structure of the Cheatsheet
    - Four rows, representing the essential "steering levels" of any system/organization. These levels could be seen as "internal system contexts" of any viable system:
        1. [[Norm]]s & [[Identity]], 
        2. [[Strategy]] & [[Innovation]], 
        3. [[Tactic]]s & [[Audit]]/[[Retrospective]]
        4. [[Operation]]s & [[Value]] Delivery
    - Furthermore, there are eight columns, which represent structural aspects, independent of each steering level. They are grouped in pairs to reduce complexity:
        1. [[Processes]] & [[Flow]]
        2. [[Artifact]] & [[Result]]s
        3. [[Task]] & [[Planning Level]]
        4. [[Roles]] & [[Contribution]]
        5. [[Meeting]]s & [[Decision Making]]
        6. [[Goal]]s & [[Metrics]]
        7. [[Capacity]] & [[Resource Bargain]]
        8. [[Tool]]s & [[Method]]s
    - Out of this structure you get __4 x 8 = 32 cells__.
    - Within each cell you find potential elements that **could** be taken into account, to bring a steering level and the corresponding structural aspect to life. It is not the intention to apply this matrix as a simple [[Checklist]]. The intention is to use it wisely and always ask yourself: Is an element in an aspect really necessary? Don't over-engineer and focus on the right topics at the right moment in time. 
    - An exploration of the [[Environment]] is always possible! Actually, one should always start with a fundamental understanding of external actors or factors. -> [[Tool: Environment Model]]
